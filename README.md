# IA-LocalSearchAlgorithms
Solving a public bicycle redistribution problem with local search algorithms


Using both local search algorithms :Hill Climbing and Simulated Annealing
and problem-solving methods such as state space representation
we tackle the problem of redistributing bicycles across a fixed space
taking into consideration both the cost of carrying the bicycles 
and the potential monetary gains for carrying x amount of bicycles to
a station that needs them.
